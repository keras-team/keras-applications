# Keras Applications

⚠️ This GitHub repository is now deprecated -- All Keras Applications models have moved into the core Keras repository and the TensorFlow pip package. All code changes and discussion should move to the Keras repository.

For users looking for a place to start using premade models, consult the [Keras API documentation](https://keras.io/api/applications/).
